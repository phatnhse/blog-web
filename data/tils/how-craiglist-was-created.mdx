[Craig Newmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Newmark), worked as a computer programmer for IBM and other investment companies. 1995, he started an email list in his spare time to get updated about different events in town. From a very simple way to communicate, the list grew so much that there wasn’t enough space in people’s inboxes: it was time for a website. 1996, he launched [Craiglist.com](https://www.craigslist.org/).

After 20 years, it becomes one of the most popular website in the world. Added the photo to show marketplace startups based on the categories from Craiglist. Dominant!
