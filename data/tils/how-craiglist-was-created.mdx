1993, [Craig Newmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Newmark), employed at an investment company, started an email list in his spare time to allow him and his friends to update each other about different events in town. Eventually, the list grew so much that there wasn’t enough space in people’s inboxes: it was time for a website. Enter [Craiglist.com](https://www.craigslist.org/).

Adding the photo to show marketplace startups carving out niches from CraigsList.
