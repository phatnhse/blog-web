There are many ways that can help you to create content for your blog. Markdown, with simple and clean syntax, works for me really well. However, I want more than that: the content should be fully customized.

Last week I read a [great post about drawing and architecture](https://app.mailbrew.com/s/newsletter/u3sjEYwSMXtL) and I thought it would be more intuitive if the author can embed a 3D model into the post. Something like this:

<LittleTokyo/>

This obviously not supported by Markdown. I did some research and found MDX is a great fit for this case as you can import and reuse React components in markdown files.

In the next post, I'll walk you through how to use MDX with Nextjs.
