title: Build a Lightweight Docker Container For Android Testing
description: Testing helps us identify any defects or errors that may have been made during development. But it takes time and resources, especially in Android where it requires the installation of many dependencies and a device to perform UI tests. By using a Docker container, we can build and run tests for multiple feature branches, speeding up the development and increasing productivity. In this tutorial, we’re going to learn how to build a lightweight Android container to isolate the testing process.

## Goals

* No Android Studio/GUI applications required.
* Android emulator runs on a Docker container.
* Accelerates build speed and stabilize testing process, especially UI Tests.
* Performance boost with Gradle dependencies and distribution caching.

## Remarks

* Assuming you have [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) and have some fundamentals knowledge about docker.
* Linux only. MacOS/Window or any solution which uses VirtualBox to embed Docker can't run x86 emulator because [nested virtualization](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/4032) is yet to support. In the contrary, ARM CPU is host machine independent, which can run anywhere, however it was deprecated and extremely slow to boot.  
* In the scope of this repo, x86 Emulator is chosen as default startup emulator since it is [10x faster](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2662650/making-the-android-emulator-run-faster) than ARM. _KVM & nested virtualization will be needed_ so Linux-based OS as host system is required, especially if you want to build a CI machine with this image.   

## 1. Start docker container

The image that we're using to build on top of is `adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:alpine`

```bash
docker run --privileged -it --name android-container adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:alpine
```

* `privileged`: grant permission to launch VM on container.

* `it`: interactively execute shell cmd.

* `name android-container`: container’s name, will use later to hijack the container

To run docker as non-root, the simplest way is adding the current user to docker group as follows:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker // Add group docker if it doesn't already exist
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker // Add current user to group docker
newgrp docker // reload (or you can re-login to reload)
docker run hello-world // check if it works
```

## 2. Install SDK packages

## Prerequisites:

Make sure you install the following dependencies for later use:

```bash
apk update && apk upgrade && apk add --no-cache bash git unzip wget libvirt-daemon qemu-img qemu-system-x86_64 dbus polkit virt-manager vim
```

## Gradle
You can either execute Gradle Wrapper or Local Installation but first option is [more preferable](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)
> In a nutshell you gain the following benefits:
> Standardizes a project on a given Gradle version, leading to more reliable and robust builds.
> Provisioning a new Gradle version to different users and execution environment (e.g. IDEs or Continuous Integration servers) is as simple as changing the Wrapper definition. 


### Get the idea of Gradle Wrapper
Gradle wrapper is a script that allow you to run the build with predefined version and settings. The generated Wrapper properties file, `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`, stores the information about the Gradle distribution.

![gradle wrapper properties](https://github.com/fastphat/android-container/blob/master/images/gradle-wrapper.png?raw=true)

Want to use newer version? Grab one at [here](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/) and update `distributionUrl` accordingly. 

### Speed up build with Gradle Caching
By default, all files downloaded under docker container doesn't persist if the container is removed. 
Therefore, they will be re-downloaded in every build. 
However, Docker offers a solution called [Volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/). 
It is typically directories or files on host filesystem and can be accessible from both container and host machine.

You just need to define a location where the volume references to and let it take care the rest, which is as follow:

```
GRADLE_USER_HOME=/cache

VOLUME $GRADLE_USER_HOME // This will be setup later in Dockerfile
```

<img src="https://github.com/fastphat/android-container/blob/master/images/docker-volume.png?raw=true" width="350px" /> <br/>  


You can always check where the volumes are located and how they work:

On Macos: 
```shell
~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/tty
```

On Linux: 
```shell
~/var/lib/docker/volumes
```

To list all volumes are being used: 
```shell
docker volume ls
```

To get all properties of a particular volume:
```shell 
docker volume inspect [volume_id]
```

### Non-cached vs cached gradle dependencies

In some circumstances, you will notice cached dependencies is big win, especially when a project has used ton of dependencies. Let's see the different between cached and non-cached gradle for Sunflower project.   

```shell
BUILD SUCCESSFULL in 4m 25s

...

BUILD SUCCESSFULL in 55s 
```

## Android SDK

We're going to download Android SDK via this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio).

> The Android software development kit (SDK) includes different components, including SDK Tools, Build Tools, and Platform Tools. The SDK Tools primarily includes the stock Android emulator, [hierarchy viewer](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/hierarchy-viewer.html), [SDK manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update.html), and [ProGuard](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Configuring-ProGuard). The Build Tools primarily include aapt (Android packaging tool to create .APK), dx (Android tool that converts .java files to .dex files). Platform Tools include the [Android debug shell](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html), [sqlite3](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sqlite3.html) and [Systrace](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/systrace-commandline.html).

Save it to `/tmp` and get it extracted in `/opt`

```bash
wget 'https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip' -P /tmp \
&& unzip -d /opt/android /tmp/sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip
```

Crucial packages are `platform-tools`, `tools` and `emulator`. Install them with this cmd:

```bash
yes Y | /opt/android/tools/bin/sdkmanager --install "platform-tools" "system-images;android-28;google_apis;x86" "platforms;android-28" "build-tools;28.0.3" "emulator"
```
* `platform-tools` contains `adb`

* `tools` contains `avdmanager` and `sdkamanager`

* `emulator` : run emulator

* `system-images;android-28;google_apis;x86` : emulator version and other options

Accept all licenses of Android SDK

```bash
yes Y | /opt/android/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```    

Seems good, now create an avd name **`test`**

```bash
echo "no" | /opt/android/tools/bin/avdmanager --verbose create avd --force --name "test" --device "pixel" --package "system-images;android-28;google_apis;x86" --tag "google_apis" --abi "x86"
```    

* `name`: device’s name.

* `abi`: CPU architecture.

* `tag google_api`: to support Google API.

Double check the result:

```bash
/opt/android/emulator/emulator -list-avds 
# Expected Result: test
```

## 3. Set up environment variables

Edit your `.bashrc` or any config file that you’re familiar with:

```bash
GRADLE_USER_HOME=/cache
ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android
PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/lib64:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/lib64/qt/lib
```

***Note***: Order matters, to resolve the issue with emulator since Android SDK provides 2 executed file for `emulator`, respectively under `/android/emulator` and `/android/tools/bin`. Check this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49511666/5460066) for more detail.

## 4. Run emulator

Here are some minor steps before running emulator:

* Stop any running emulators with ADB.

* Start emulator in the background with flag `-no-window` and `-gpu off`

* Turn off animation to avoid flaky tests.

Put everything all together in this `start.sh` file:
```bash
function check_kvm() {
  cpu_support_hardware_acceleration=$(grep -cw ".*\(vmx\|svm\).*" /proc/cpuinfo)
  if [ "$cpu_support_hardware_acceleration" != 0 ]; then
    echo 1
  else
    echo 0
  fi
}

function config_emulator_settings() {
  adb shell "settings put global window_animation_scale 0.0"
  adb shell "settings put global transition_animation_scale 0.0"
  adb shell "settings put global animator_duration_scale 0.0"
  adb shell "settings put global always_finish_activities 1"
  adb shell "settings put secure show_ime_with_hard_keyboard 0"
  adb shell "am broadcast -a com.android.intent.action.SET_LOCALE --es com.android.intent.extra.LOCALE EN"
}

function wait_emulator_to_be_ready() {
  adb devices | grep emulator | cut -f1 | while read line; do adb -s $line emu kill; done
  emulator -avd "${EMULATOR_NAME_x86}" -verbose -no-boot-anim -wipe-data -no-snapshot -no-window -gpu off &
  boot_completed=false
  while [ "$boot_completed" == false ]; do
    status=$(adb wait-for-device shell getprop sys.boot_completed | tr -d '\r')
    echo "Boot Status: $status"

    if [ "$status" == "1" ]; then
      boot_completed=true
    else
      sleep 1
    fi
  done
}

function start_emulator_if_possible() {
  check_kvm=$(check_kvm)
  if [ "$check_kvm" != "1" ]; then
    echo "run emulator failed, nested virtualization is not supported"
    return
  else
    wait_emulator_to_be_ready
    sleep 1
    config_emulator_settings
  fi
}

start_emulator_if_possible
```

Start the emulator with sh `start.sh` or `./start.sh` and wait until `Boot Status: 1` which means the device is fully loaded and ready to use.

Check again by enter `bg` to see the background jobs.

```bash
$ ./start.sh
emulator: WARNING: Your AVD has been configured with an in-guest renderer, but the system image does not support guest rendering.Falling back to 'swiftshader_indirect' mode.
WARNING: change of renderer detected.
checkValid: hw configs not eq
emulator: Cold boot: different AVD configuration
Your emulator is out of date, please update by launching Android Studio:
- Start Android Studio
- Select menu "Tools > Android > SDK Manager"
- Click "SDK Tools" tab
- Check "Android Emulator" checkbox
- Click "OK"

Boot Status:
Boot Status:
Boot Status:
Boot Status:
Boot Status:
Boot Status:
Boot Status:
Boot Status:
Boot Status:
Boot Status: 1
emulator: INFO: boot completed
emulator: INFO: boot time 13200 ms
emulator: Increasing screen off timeout, logcat buffer size to 2M.
emulator: Revoking microphone permissions for Google App.
```

Check running emulators

```bash
adb devices
List of devices attached
emulator-5554 device
```

Now we have an Android emulator running in the container successfully!

## 5. Build docker image

Open a new terminal tab, stop `android-container` and commit your changes to create a new docker image:

```bash
docker stop android-container && docker commit android-container android-container:v1
```

Test once again:

```bash
docker images
# Expected result: REPOSITORY          TAG
                   android-container   v1
```

## 6. Build project and run tests

We'll try to build and run E2E testing with project [Sunflower](https://github.com/android/sunflower).
 
Step 1: Clone and go to top level directory of `sunflower`
 
 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/android/sunflower && cd sunflower/
 ```
 
Step 2: Run with privileged permission in order to boot emulator on the container, then run gradle tasks (build project and run test suite)
 
 ```shell
 docker run --privileged -it \
 --rm -v $PWD:/data -v gradle-cache:/cache android-container:v1 \
 bash -c '. /start.sh && /data/gradlew test -p /data'
 ```

If you want to run UI test, make sure KVM is enable and run this gradle task `connectedAndroidTest`
```shell
/data/gradlew test connectedAndroidTest -p /data
```

## 7. Dockerfile
I created this `Dockerfile` so you can extend from there with any addtional configuration.
